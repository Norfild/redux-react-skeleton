# Redux React Skeleton
This skeleton is designed to get up and running with a bunch of awesome new front-end technologies, all on top of a configurable, feature-rich webpack build system that's already setup to provide hot reloading, CSS modules with Sass support, unit testing, code coverage reports, bundle splitting, and a whole lot more.

## Requirements
- ``` $ node -v ``` is a **^4.2.0**

- ``` $ npm -v ``` is a **^3.0.0**


## Instalation
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Noxwille/redux-react-skeleton.git
$ cd redux-react-skeleton
$ npm install 
```


## Development

- ``` $ npm run devserver ``` - Runs the project in development mode with hot-reloading of 'public' folder. Open your browser at http://localhost:3030.

- ``` $ npm run build ``` - Provide **compiled**, and **minified** bundles to 'public' directory.

- ``` npm run test ``` - Runs tests **once** with Mocha(server side interpretation). Entry point: **'test/setup.js'**.  

- ``` npm run test:watch ``` - **Continuously** watch changes and run tests immediately after changes. 

- ``` npm run lint ``` - Runs eslint checker **once**. Entry point: **'.eslintrc'**.  

- ``` npm run lint:watch ``` - **Continuously** watch changes and run Run eslint checker immediately after some changes.
